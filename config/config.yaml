# File: config/config.yaml
# Main configuration for the BreatheEasy project

# File and Directory Paths (relative to project root)
paths:
  data_file: data/Post-Processing/CSV_Files/Master_AQI_Dataset.csv
  models_dir: models/

# API Configuration
apis:
  aqicn:
    base_url: "https://api.waqi.info/feed"
  weatherapi:
    base_url: "http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json"
  # Add other API configs here if needed

# Modeling Configuration
modeling:
  target_cities: # Keep your list
    - Delhi
    - Mumbai
    - Bangalore
    - Chennai
    - Hyderabad
  prophet_model_version: "v3_weather" # Use new version suffix
  forecast_days: 3 # Use 3-day forecast horizon
  residual_decay_factor: 0.85 # Keep or adjust if desired
  # List the weather columns to use as regressors
  # Choose a subset based on likely importance & availability in forecasts
  weather_regressors:
    - temperature_2m # Daily Avg Temp
    - relative_humidity_2m # Daily Avg Humidity
    - rain 
    - wind_speed_10m # Daily Avg Wind Speed
    - pressure_msl # Daily Avg Pressure
    - cloud_cover # Daily Avg Cloud Cover
    - wind_gusts_10m 
    # --- Likely Omit ---
    # - apparent_temperature (often highly correlated with temp/humidity)
    # - dew_point_2m (correlated with temp/humidity)
    # - precipitation (often redundant if 'rain' is used)
    # - snowfall / snow_depth (likely irrelevant for most target cities)
    # - cloud_cover_low/mid/high (total cloud_cover might be sufficient)
    # - wind_speed_100m (10m is usually more relevant for surface pollution)
    # - wind_direction_10m / wind_direction_100m (complex to use as regressor)

# Logging Configuration (Example - can be refined later)
logging:
  level: INFO # Overall level for handlers (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
  format: '%(asctime)s - [%(levelname)s] - %(name)s - %(filename)s:%(lineno)d - %(message)s' # Added logger name '%(name)s'
  log_to_file: true # Set to true to enable file logging
  log_filename: app.log # Name of the log file (will appear in project root)
  log_file_level: DEBUG # Log DEBUG and above to file, INFO and above to console (example)
  log_console_level: INFO # Log INFO and above to console
