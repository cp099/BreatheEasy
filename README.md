# BreatheEasy - AQI Analysis and Forecasting

This project aims to analyze historical Air Quality Index (AQI) data, provide insights into associated health risks, and predict future AQI levels for major Indian cities.

## Problem Statement

Air quality index (AQI) data is widely available, but most weather websites only provide numerical values without clear insights into the health risks associated with air pollution... [Your Full Problem Statement Here] ... By providing both real-time health risk analysis and predictive insights, this project will empower individuals to take proactive measures for their respiratory health.

## Features

1.  **Historical Summary:** Display trends and summaries of past AQI data per city.
2.  **Educational Info:** Explain AQI, pollutants, and health risks.
3.  **Current AQI:** Show real-time AQI from an external API.
4.  **AQI Forecast:** Predict AQI for the next week using ML models.
5.  **Current Pollutants & Risks:** Show real-time pollutant levels and associated immediate health triggers.
6.  **Predicted Risks:** Forecast potential health risks for the upcoming week based on predicted AQI.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd BREATHEEASY
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate it (Windows)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # Activate it (macOS/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Place data:** Ensure `Master_AQI_Dataset.csv` is in `data/Post-Processing/CSV_Files/`.
5.  **API Keys (if applicable):** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary API keys (e.g., `AQI_API_KEY=your_key_here`). Make sure `.env` is in your `.gitignore`.

## Usage

*(Add instructions on how to run the analysis, train models, or start the application later)*

```bash
# Example: Run analysis notebook
jupyter notebook notebook/1_Historical_Analysis.ipynb

# Example: Start the web app (if applicable)
# python src/app/main.py

**4. `BREATHEEASY/src/__init__.py`**

*   **Action:** Create this *empty* file inside the `src` directory.
*   **Purpose:** This file tells Python that the `src` directory should be treated as a package, allowing you to import modules from it using `import src.module_name` or `from src import module_name`.
*   **Content:** The file can be completely empty.

```python
# File: src/__init__.py
# This file intentionally left blank to mark 'src' as a Python package.
