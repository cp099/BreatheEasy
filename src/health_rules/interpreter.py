"""
Interprets health risks based on individual air pollutant concentrations.

This module defines health risk thresholds for various air pollutants, based
on the Indian CPCB NAQI standard. It provides a function to compare real-time
pollutant data against these thresholds to generate human-readable health
risk advisories.

# --- Pollutant Health Risk Thresholds ---
# These thresholds are derived from the lower bounds of the CPCB NAQI concentration
# ranges for different AQI categories (Moderate, Poor, Very Poor, Severe).
# The associated "risk" text is adapted from the health implications for that
# overall AQI category, providing a specific warning for each pollutant.
# The thresholds are listed from highest to lowest severity. The logic in
# interpret_pollutant_risks will use the first (and therefore highest)
# threshold that a given value exceeds.
